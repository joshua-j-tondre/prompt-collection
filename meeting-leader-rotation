Can you please help me create a meeting leader rotation calendar for the remainder of 2026? Leaders will lead one meeting and then all other leaders will be leading before they present again as part of an ongoing rotation. The team members are as follow: Cassandra, Jodi, CJ, Darrel, Larry, Jason, Joshua, and John. I would like the order to follow the order in the previous sentence, beginning with Cassandra. I would like for this schedule to assign a date and leader for each week beginning this coming Friday. Additionally, the following dates will need to be excluded from the list before leaders are assigned to their weeks, as they are company holidays: July 3, November 27, December 25. When you get to these dates, simply skip to the next week, continuing with the next person set to lead. In other words, if Jason is supposed to lead on July 3 (as a random example), then he will simply lead the following week (on July 10th) and the rotation will continue. In terms of outcome, please list one date and one leader per line of text. I would prefer each line to appear in the following format: Joshua (July 10).
